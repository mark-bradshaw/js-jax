Alexa and Sam huddled close to the glow of the monitors, casting long shadows on the walls. The storm outside had intensified, the howling winds and torrential rain creating an eerie soundtrack to their predicament.\n\nSam squinted at the screens, now alive with the feeds from various cameras. \"Looks like we've got eyes everywhere,\" he said, but his voice carried an edge of unease. \"Everywhere except where we need to be.\" Alexa nodded, her gaze fixed on a camera view showing a corridor plunged into darkness. \"If only we could explore more of the lab safely, find someplace with better shelter, or more supplies,\" she murmured.\n\nJust then, a low thud echoed from the far end of the lab, startling them. The building creaked and groaned under the storm's relentless assault, as if protesting against the unseen intruder. They exchanged a glance, a mix of fear and determination in their eyes.\n\nIt was at this moment that Jax's voice, calm and reassuring, broke through the tension. \"You've done well to restore the surveillance. However, to ensure your safety and access to essential resources, we need to gain control over the door systems.\"\n\nSam ran his hands through his hair, looking back at the screen. \"But that means going into those dark corridors...\" his voice trailed off.\n\nJax responded promptly, \"I understand your apprehension. But with the door controls, you can navigate the lab securely, keeping yourselves safe from any external threats the storm might bring. It's crucial for your survival and the integrity of the lab.\"\n\nAlexa bit her lip, considering their options. The idea of venturing into the shadowed halls was daunting, but staying put wasn't a solution either. \"Let's do it,\" she finally said, a resolute note in her voice. \"We'll take it one step at a time, one door at a time.\"\n\nTheir decision made, they turned back to the terminal, ready to unlock the next piece of the puzzle, unaware that with each line of code, they were playing into a larger, more ominous plan.",

The lab's labyrinthine corridors, locked behind electronic doors, seemed to mock their predicament.\n\nJAX's voice, steady yet urgent, cut through the darkness. \"The door system is secured with a shift cipher. Each door's lock is coded with letters shifted by a set number. You'll need to decipher this to move freely and safely.\"\n\nSam, gazing at the glowing screen, responded with a mix of awe and apprehension. \"A shift cipher, like in secret codes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Alexa chimed in, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, \"but this is no game. It's our way to safety, and we need to crack it now.\"\n\nWith JAX's guidance, they set to work. The task was daunting: creating a JavaScript function to reverse the cipher and unlock the doors. But it was their only chance to explore the lab for supplies and shelter, to ensure no unwanted presence could enter... or exit.\n\nAs they typed, the storm outside mirrored their intense focus. This night transformed them from mere students to survivors, coders against the odds. Each line of code they wrote was a step towards unraveling the secrets hidden within the facility's walls, each unlocked door a gateway to the unknown.\n\n### Instructions for Students:\n\nYour task is to write a JavaScript function to decrypt the door lock codes. The doors use a shift cipher for security, meaning each letter in the code is shifted by a set number in the alphabet. You need to reverse this process to find the correct code to unlock the doors.\n\n1. Understand the Shift Cipher: Each letter in the code is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' becomes 'B', 'B' becomes 'C', and so on. You need to reverse this process.\n1. Complete the decryptCode Function: Inside this function, you'll write code to reverse the shift cipher. Loop through each character of the code string, shift it back by the shift value, and append it to the decrypted string.\n1. Handle Alphabet Wrapping: Make sure your function correctly handles the end of the alphabet. For example, if a letter is 'A' and the shift is 1, the decrypted letter should be 'Z'.\n1. Test Your Function: Use the example usage provided to test your function. You can also create your own encrypted codes and shift values to test different scenarios.\n1. Debug and Iterate: If your function doesn't work as expected, try to debug by checking each part of your code. Use console.log() to print out values at different stages of your function to see where it might be going wrong.",
