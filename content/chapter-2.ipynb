                "In the aftermath of their success with the surveillance systems, the main lab becomes a small island of dim, flickering light in an ocean of darkness.  However at least now Alexa and Sam can see what's going on around them, if they can only fix the lights.  They huddle close to the monitors' glow, casting long, flickering shadows against the walls. Outside, the storm's fury mounts, its howling winds and torrential downpour creating an unsettling soundtrack to their dire situation.\n",

                "A sudden, low thud from the lab's far end cuts through the silence, startling them. The building itself seems to shudder and groan under the storm's relentless siege, voicing its defiance against an unseen adversary. They share a glance, their expressions a complex tapestry of fear and resolve.\n",
                "\n",
                "At this moment, JAX's calm, reassuring voice pierces the tension. \"Excellent work restoring the cameras.  That will be essential to our efforts, but we have one other thing to do before we can work on restoring power.  For your safety and to secure essential resources, we must take control of the door systems. Not only are vital areas like power control currently inaccessible due to automatic lockdowns, but external doors may be dangerously unlocked. The control room is not too far away, and it holds the key to navigating the labs.\"\n",

                "\n",
                "JAX promptly adds, \"I share your concerns. Yet, mastering the door controls is imperative. It allows us to seal off external threats; intruders or wild animals seeking refuge from the storm. Equally, we must ensure access to all internal areas to get you help and ensure the lab's integrity.\"\n",
                "\n",
                "Alexa bites her lip, pondering their grim options. The prospect of delving into the shadowed depths is terrifying, yet inaction poses its own peril. With steel in her voice, she declares, \"We can do it. Step by step, door by door.\"\n",

As they prepare to navigate the labyrinthine darkness, they are unaware that with each door they unlock or seal, they are drawing closer to unveiling a larger, hidden truth that lurks within the storm's shadow."

                "1. Understand the Shift Cipher: Each letter in the code is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on. You need to reverse this process.\n",
                "1. Complete the decryptCode Function: Inside this function, you'll write code to reverse the shift cipher. Loop through each character of the code string, shift it back by the shift value, and append it to the decrypted string.\n",
                "1. Handle Alphabet Wrapping: Make sure your function correctly handles the end of the alphabet. For example, if an encoded letter is 'a' and the shift is 1, the decrypted letter should go back to the end of the alphabet to 'z'.\n",
                "1. Test Your Function: Use the example usage provided to test your function. You can also create your own encrypted codes and shift values to test different scenarios.\n",
                "1. Debug and Iterate: If your function doesn't work as expected, try to debug by checking each part of your code. Use console.log() to print out values at different stages of your function to see where it might be going wrong."
