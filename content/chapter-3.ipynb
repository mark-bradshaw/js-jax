The noise was startling, a stark reminder of the desolate atmosphere enveloping them. Despite their success, the hallways remained dark and ominous, with only occasional emergency lights piercing the shadows. The storm outside seemed to mock their progress, its howls and rumbles a constant backdrop to their uneasy journey.\n",

                "\"We need to get back to the main lab,\" Alexa whispered, her voice barely audible over the storm's fury.

                "Navigating the labyrinthine facility felt different now. With each door that obediently swung open at their approach, a small sense of victory pierced the overwhelming sense of isolation.

                "\"Good job, and welcome back.  We've made a lot of progress, but now we need to focus on the power systems,\" JAX announced, its voice cutting through the relative silence of the lab. The urgency in its tone was clear, underscoring the critical nature of their next task. \"The backup generators and batteries are offline. Without them, we're left in the cold and dark. And if we can bring them back online, we might be able to power up essential equipment for our next steps.\"\n",

Yet, with each task they accomplished, their determination grew stronger, fueled by the knowledge that they were not just fighting for survival but forging a path forward, step by painstaking step."

You could make a bunch of variables called `temp1`, `temp2`, `temp3` etc., but that would get really hard to keep up with.  Instead we can use a **single array** variable to hold all the temperatures.\n",

You can ask the array for a specific value at any position you want.  You do this by using the array name and putting the position number in square brackets after it, like `temperatures[0]`.  This would give you the first item in the temperatures array, which is 56.2.\n",
