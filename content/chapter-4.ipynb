JAX, the guiding AI voice, explained the situation. \"The lab's power systems are in disarray, and we're operating in the dark. We need to activate the backup generators, monitor the battery banks, and ensure all systems are running within their power limits to avoid overloads or shutdowns.\"\n",

Each component's status included whether it was on or off, its startup order, current power consumption, and power limits. \"By analyzing this data,\" JAX instructed, \"you'll determine the next steps to stabilize the power grid. It could mean turning a system on, adjusting power levels, or maintaining the current state if everything is operating as it should.\"\n",

The lab's survival depended on their ability to think logically, applying what they had learned about variables, conditionals, loops, and objects. Their code would need to sift through the grid's components, making decisions to ensure a steady supply of power to the lab. This was no small feat, given the complexity of the task and their relative newness to coding. But the knowledge they had acquired gave them hope.\n",
