        "# Chapter 1: The Unintended Detour\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://mark-bradshaw.github.io/js-jax/files/extras/images/students-entering-building.png\" width=\"50%\" align=\"right\" />Nestled in the heart of Silicon Foothills lies the renowned HelixTech Research Facility, a gleaming monument to human ingenuity and the pursuit of knowledge. It's here that a group of students, including Alexa and Sam, arrive for a field trip, eager to glimpse the future of technology. Their eyes wide with wonder, they tour the facility's cutting-edge labs and corridors filled with patents and prototypes, each exhibit more captivating than the last.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the day progresses, dark clouds gather overhead, and distant thunder warns of an approaching storm. The facility's staff, heeding the severe weather alerts, initiate a swift but orderly evacuation. Amidst the anticipation of the storm, Alexa and Sam become particularly engrossed with a demonstration in a secluded part of the lab. This area, away from the main tour path, is overseen by Dr. Eleni Rivera, a leading researcher who is showcasing a groundbreaking project on quantum computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dr. Rivera, impressed by their keen interest, offers a more in-depth explanation just as the evacuation begins. The lab's remote location and its special soundproofing, designed to prevent electromagnetic interference with sensitive experiments, inadvertently isolate them from the commotion of the evacuating crowds. Dr. Rivera, called away urgently by a colleague for an evacuation-related task, steps out, assuring them she would return momentarily.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the chaos of the moment, a miscommunication leads to the absence of Alexa and Sam going unnoticed. Dr. Rivera, caught up in her responsibilities, forgets to inform the evacuation team about the two students in the quantum computing lab. The facility, now devoid of its usual hum of activity, becomes eerily silent as the storm intensifies outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "The power fluctuates, and emergency lights flicker to life, casting an eerie glow. The once bustling HelixTech Research Facility now feels like a ghost of its former self, with only the howling winds and the echo of thunder for company. Alexa and Sam, realizing the gravity of their situation, decide to seek shelter and attempt to find a way out.\n",
        "\n",
        "With their cell phones left on the bus and the facility's exits secured in preparation for the storm, they make their way back to the main lab, hoping to find someone who can help. Instead, they encounter a lone computer terminal that, amidst the power surges, remains on, a solitary beacon in the gloom.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://mark-bradshaw.github.io/js-jax/files/extras/images/sam-alexa-looking-at-screen.png\" width=\"80%\"/>\n",
        "\n",
        "The screen suddenly illuminates with a friendly avatar, introducing itself as JAX, the AI in charge of the lab. With the power out, JAX urgently needs their help to re-establish control of the lab's critical systems. Without their assistance, the AI cannot prevent the potential destruction of valuable research or guarantee their safety amidst the storm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seizing the opportunity, Alexa and Sam decide to engage with JAX, who seems more than willing to guide them through the intricacies of the lab's systems. Amidst the echoing thunder and the relentless rain against the windows, they begin their unplanned tutorial in the programming language that powers the very technology around them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under JAX's guidance the two begin their unplanned lessons, typing out code that slowly begins to make some sense. As the storm rages on outside, Alexa and Sam are drawn deeper into a world where technology and determination intersect, holding onto the hope that their newfound knowledge can avert disaster and perhaps, in the process, open the way back home.\n"

        "Huddled in the main lab, surrounded by the hum of dormant machinery, Alexa and Sam feel the weight of isolation in the sprawling facility. Jax's voice, a digital echo in the quiet, breaks the silence. \"The surveillance system is currently inaccessible due to a security protocol that automatically encrypted the camera feeds due to the evacuation and lockdown,\" Jax explains.\n",

        "Sam peers at the array of screens, all displaying encrypted error messages instead of visual feeds. \"So, we're blind here?\" he asks. \"Not for long,\" Alexa interjects with determination. \"JAX, can you guide us on how to decrypt these feeds from here?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Certainly,\" JAX replies. \"Each camera's feed is encrypted with a unique numeric code as part of our security measures. By cracking these codes, we can bypass the encryption and regain visual control over the lab. Itâ€™s a straightforward task of applying the decryption algorithm.\"\n",
