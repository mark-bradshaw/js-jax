It's here that a group of students, including Alexa and Sam, arrive for a field trip, eager to glimpse the future of technology. Their eyes wide with wonder, they tour the facility's cutting-edge labs and corridors filled with patents and prototypes, each exhibit more captivating than the last.\n",

        "As the day progresses, dark clouds gather overhead, and distant thunder warns of an approaching storm. The facility's staff, heeding the severe weather alerts, initiate a swift but orderly evacuation. In the chaos of the moment, a miscommunication leads to Alexa and Sam being left in the now abandoned building, their presence unnoticed by the hurrying employees.\n",

        "With their cell phones left on the bus and the facility's exits secured, Alexa and Sam return to the main lab, seeking shelter until the storm passes. It's there they encounter a lone computer terminal that, to their astonishment amidst the power surges, remains on, a solitary beacon in the gloom.\n",

Without their help the AI cannot prevent the destruction of the lab, or guarantee their safety.  The two friends decide to engage with JAX, who seems eager to teach them the language that powers the very technology around them.  Hopefully they can learn what they need to prevent disaster.\n",

The storm rages outside, and it seems that for now at least, the future remains unseen. \n"

Jax's voice, a digital echo in the quiet, broke the silence. \"The surveillance system is down due to the power fluctuations. It's essential for monitoring the lab's critical areas, especially now when visibility is limited,\" Jax explained.\n",
