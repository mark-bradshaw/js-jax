        "<img src=\"https://mark-bradshaw.github.io/js-jax/files/extras/images/students-entering-building.png\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 1rem; width: 50%;\" />Nestled in the heart of Silicon Foothills lies the renowned HelixTech Research Facility, a gleaming monument to human ingenuity and the pursuit of knowledge. It's here that a group of students, including Alexa and Sam, arrive for a field trip, eager to glimpse the future of technology. Their eyes wide with wonder, they tour the facility's cutting-edge labs and corridors filled with patents and prototypes, each exhibit more captivating than the last.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the day progresses, dark clouds gather overhead, and distant thunder warns of an approaching storm.  Amidst the anticipation of the storm, Alexa and Sam become particularly engrossed with a demonstration in a secluded part of the lab. This area, away from the main tour path, is overseen by Dr. Eleni Rivera, a leading researcher who is showcasing a groundbreaking project on quantum computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dr. Rivera, impressed by their keen interest, offers a more in-depth explanation to the two as the rest of the tour continues on.  Dr. Rivera is called away, and promises to return momentarily.  The storm has worsened dramatically.  There will be flash floods, tornados and extreme lightning that the facility is not hardened against.  The facility's staff, heeding the severe weather alerts, initiate a swift but orderly evacuation. Dr. Rivera engages fully in preparing to leave, but in the excitement forgets about the two isolated students.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lab's remote location and its special soundproofing, designed to prevent electromagnetic interference with sensitive experiments, inadvertently isolate Alexa and Sam from the commotion of the evacuating crowds. In the chaos of the moment, the absence of Alexa and Sam going unnoticed. Dr. Rivera, caught up in her responsibilities, forgets to inform the evacuation team about the two students in the quantum computing lab. The facility, now devoid of its usual hum of activity, becomes eerily silent as the storm intensifies outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "The power fluctuates, and emergency lights flicker to life, casting an eerie glow. The once bustling HelixTech Research Facility now feels like a ghost of its former self, with only the howling winds and the echo of thunder for company.  No one is in sight.  Alexa and Sam, suddenly realizing they are alone in the huge building, pull out their cell phones to contact anyone, but the storm has knocked out cell reception and Internet access.  Confused about what is happening, but understanding the gravity of their situation, they decide to seek shelter and figure out what to do next.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the facility's main entrance locked down in preparation for the storm, they make their way back to the main lab, hoping to find someone who can help. Instead, they encounter a lone computer terminal that, despite the power outages, remains on, a solitary beacon in the gloom.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://mark-bradshaw.github.io/js-jax/files/extras/images/sam-alexa-looking-at-screen.png\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-right: 1rem; width: 50%; \" /> The screen suddenly illuminates with a friendly face that looks human, but not quite natural.  It introduces itself as JAX, the AI in charge of the lab. With the power out and all systems down, JAX urgently needs their help to re-establish control of the lab's critical systems. Without their assistance, the AI cannot prevent the potential destruction of valuable research or guarantee their safety amidst the storm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seizing the opportunity to regain some control, Alexa and Sam decide to work with JAX, who seems more than willing to guide them through the intricacies of the lab's systems. Amidst the echoing thunder and the relentless rain against the windows, they begin their unplanned lessons, typing out code that slowly begins to make some sense. As the storm rages on outside, Alexa and Sam desperately focus, holding onto the hope that their newfound knowledge can avert disaster and perhaps, in the process, open the way back home.\n"
